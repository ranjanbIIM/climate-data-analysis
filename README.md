## Analyzing Climate Data using Python Libraries
## \#AzurePyday

In this mini project, I learnt to analyze climate data for social good using Python Libraries on Azure Notebooks.

Data from NASA's resource https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/ is used in this project.

This mini project is based on the Microsoft Learn's Learning Path - Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks.
